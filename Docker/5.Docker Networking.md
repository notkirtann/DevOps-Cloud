# Docker for Developers - Part 5: Docker Networking

Container networking refers to the ability for containers to connect to and communicate with each other, and with non-Docker network services.

Containers have networking enabled by default, and they can make outgoing connections. A container has no information about what kind of network it's attached to, or whether its network peers are also Docker containers. A container only sees a network interface with an IP address, a gateway, a routing table, DNS services, and other networking details.
## Docker Network Types
Docker provides several built-in network types to facilitate different networking scenarios:
1. **Bridge Network**: This is the default network type for containers. When you start a container, it is connected to the default bridge network unless specified otherwise. Containers on the same bridge network can communicate with each other using their IP addresses or container names.
2. **Host Network**: In this mode, a container shares the host's networking namespace. This means that the container will use the host's IP address and port space. This is useful for performance-sensitive applications but can lead to port conflicts.
3. **Overlay Network**: This network type allows containers running on different Docker hosts to communicate with each other. Overlay networks are typically used in Docker Swarm or Kubernetes environments to enable multi-host networking.
4. **Macvlan Network**: This network type allows you to assign a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device on the network. This is useful for scenarios where you need to integrate containers into existing network infrastructures.
5. **None Network**: This network type disables all networking for the container. The container will not have any network interfaces, making it completely isolated from the network.

## Managing Docker Networks
You can manage Docker networks using the Docker CLI. Here are some common commands:
-  **connect**  Connect a container to a network
-  **create**   Create a network
-  **disconnect**  Disconnect a container from a network
-  **inspect**  Display detailed information on one or more networks
-  **ls**  List networks
-  **prune**  Remove all unused networks
-  **rm**  Remove one or more networks

### conatiner talk same network
```bash
docker network exec -it <network_name> ping <container_name_or_ip>
```
### conatiner talk different network
```bash
docker network connect <network_name> <container_name>
```
### create network and add container to it
```bash
docker network create <network_name>
docker run -itd --name <container_name> --network <network_name> <image_name>
```
### connect two containers in different networks
```bash
docker network connect <network_name_> <container_name_1> <container_name_2>
```
## command related to docker network
Milkyway is slef created network name
valverde ramos ronaldo conatainer in milkyway network
```bash   
docker network create milkyway
docker run -itd --network=milkyway --name=valverde busybox #create valverde container in milkyway network
docker run -itd --network=milkyway --name=ramos busybox #create ramos container in milkyway network
docker network inspect milkyway
docker network disconnect milkyway valverde
docker network connect milkyway valverde 
docker exec valverde ping container-one #connect valverde to container-one  which is of different network
docker newtwork ramos ping container-one # now can ping because connected to same network
```
