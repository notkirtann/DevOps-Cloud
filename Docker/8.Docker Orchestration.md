# Docker for Developers - Part: 8 Docker Orchestration
Docker Orchestration refers to the management and coordination of multiple Docker containers across a cluster of machines. It allows you to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications in a production environment. There are several popular Docker orchestration tools available, including Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Apache Mesos.

## Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a powerful and flexible framework for managing complex applications across a cluster of machines. Kubernetes uses a declarative approach to define the desired state of your application, and it automatically manages the underlying infrastructure to ensure that the desired state is maintained. With Kubernetes, you can easily scale your application up or down, perform rolling updates, and manage the lifecycle of your containers.

## Docker Swarm
Docker Swarm is a native clustering and orchestration tool for Docker. It allows you to create and manage a cluster of Docker nodes, and it provides features such as service discovery, load balancing, and scaling. Docker Swarm uses a simple and intuitive API that integrates seamlessly with the Docker CLI, making it easy to deploy and manage your applications. With Docker Swarm, you can easily scale your services, perform rolling updates, and manage the lifecycle of your containers.

## Apache Mesos
Apache Mesos is a distributed systems kernel that abstracts the entire data center into a single pool of resources. It provides a powerful and flexible platform for running containerized applications at scale. Mesos allows you to run a variety of workloads, including Docker containers, on a shared cluster of machines. It provides features such as resource isolation, fault tolerance, and scalability. With Apache Mesos, you can easily deploy and manage your applications across a cluster of machines, and it can handle the complexities of resource management and scheduling for you.
