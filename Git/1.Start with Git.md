# Git GitHub - Theory and Pratical

### Diffrence between Git and GitHub
- Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes in your code and collaborate with others. It is a tool that you install on your local machine.
- GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides a user interface and additional features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and collaboration tools.

### Basic Git Commands
- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
- `git clone <repository_url>`: Clones an existing Git repository from a remote source
- `git add <file>`: Stages changes to be committed.
- `git commit -m "commit message"`: Commits the staged changes with a descriptive message.
- `git push`: Pushes the committed changes to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository to your local repository.
- `git status`: Displays the status of the working directory and staging area.
- `git log`: Shows the commit history for the current branch. `q` to exit the log view.
- `git branch`: Lists all branches in the repository.
- `git checkout <branch_name>`: Switches to the specified branch.
- `git merge <branch_name>`: Merges the specified branch into the current branch.

### Basic Workflow
1. Initialize a Git repository using `git init` or clone an existing one using `git clone <repository_url>`.
2. Make changes to your files.  
3. Stage the changes using `git add <file>` or `git add .` to stage all changes.
4. Commit the changes with a descriptive message using `git commit -m "commit message"
5. Push the changes to a remote repository using `git push`.
6. To update your local repository with changes from the remote repository, use `git pull`.

## .git hidden folder
- When you initialize a Git repository, a hidden folder named `.git` is created in the root directory of your project. This folder contains all the information about the repository, including configuration settings, commit history, branches, and more.

- The `.git` folder is essential for Git to function properly, and it should not be modified or deleted manually. Instead, use Git commands to interact with the repository.

- Inside the `.git` folder, you will find several important subdirectories and files, such as:
  - `HEAD`: A file that points to the current branch reference.
  - `config`: A file that contains repository-specific configuration settings.
  - `objects/`: A directory that stores all the objects (commits, trees, blobs) in the repository.
  - `refs/`: A directory that contains references to branches and tags.
    - `logs/`: A directory that contains logs of changes made to the references.
    - `heads/`: A directory that contains references to the heads of branches.
    - `tags/`: A directory that contains references to tags.

- Understanding the structure and contents of the `.git` folder can help you better understand how Git works under the hood. However, it is generally recommended to interact with Git through its commands rather than directly manipulating the files in the `.git` folder.

## Workflow with GitHub
1. Create a repository on GitHub.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository_url>`.
3. Make changes to your files locally.
4. Stage and commit your changes using `git add <file>` and `git commit -m "commit message"`.
5. Push your changes to the GitHub repository using `git push`.
6. To collaborate with others, you can create branches, make changes, and open pull requests on GitHub.
7. Review and merge pull requests to integrate changes into the main branch.
8. Regularly pull changes from the remote repository to keep your local repository up to date using `git pull`.

### Staging Area
- The staging area, also known as the index, is an intermediate area where changes are gathered before they are committed to the repository. When you make changes to your files, they are not immediately committed; instead, you need to stage them first using the `git add` command.
- The staging area allows you to selectively choose which changes to include in the next commit. You can stage specific files or even specific parts of a file.
- Once you have staged the desired changes, you can commit them to the repository using the `git commit` command. The commit will include all the changes that were staged in the staging area.
- The staging area provides flexibility and control over the commit process, allowing you to create meaningful and organized commits.

### Branching, Merging and conflicts
- Branching is a powerful feature in Git that allows you to create separate lines of development within a repository. Each branch represents an independent version of the codebase, allowing you to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.
- To create a new branch, you can use the command `git branch <branch_name>`. This creates a new branch based on the current branch.
- To switch to a different branch, you can use the command `git checkout <branch_name>`. This updates your working directory to reflect the state of the selected branch.
- Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. To merge a branch into the current branch, you can use the command `git merge <branch_name>`. This combines the changes from the specified branch into the current branch.
- Branching and merging enable collaborative development, allowing multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously and integrate their changes seamlessly.
- Conflicts can occur during the merging process when changes made in different branches affect the same lines of code. When a conflict arises, Git will mark the conflicting sections in the affected files, and you will need to manually resolve the conflicts by editing the files.
- After resolving conflicts, you need to stage the changes using `git add <file>` and then commit the merge using `git commit`. This finalizes the merge and incorporates the resolved changes into the current branch.
### Useful Git Commands
- `git diff`: Shows the differences between the working directory and the staging area or between two commits.
- `git reset <file>`: Unstages a file from the staging area.    
- `git rm <file>`: Removes a file from the working directory and stages the removal for commit.
- `git stash`: Temporarily saves changes in the working directory that are not yet ready to be committed.
- `git stash pop`: Applies the most recent stashed changes and removes them from the stash.
- `git remote`: Manages remote repository connections.
- `git fetch`: Downloads changes from a remote repository without merging them into the local repository.
- `git tag <tag_name>`: Creates a tag for a specific commit, often used for marking release points.
- `git show <commit_hash>`: Displays detailed information about a specific commit.
- `git cherry-pick <commit_hash>`: Applies the changes from a specific commit onto the current branch.

### Git Diff and Stashing
- `git diff` is a command that shows the differences between the working directory and the staging area or between two commits. It highlights the changes made to files, allowing you to see what has been added, modified, or deleted.
- You can use `git diff` without any arguments to see the differences between the working directory and the staging area. This helps you review changes before staging them.
- You can also specify two commits to compare their differences using `git diff <commit1> <commit2>`.

- `git stash` is a command that temporarily saves changes in the working directory that are not yet ready to be committed. It allows you to set aside your changes and revert to a clean working directory.
- When you run `git stash`, Git saves your changes and restores the working directory to the state of the last commit. This is useful when you need to switch branches or work on something else without committing your current changes.
- To apply the most recent stashed changes and remove them from the stash, you can use `git stash pop`. This restores your changes to the working directory.
